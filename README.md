Short Summary
The core components of the project include:

React App: The frontend of the application was developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allowed for the creation of dynamic and responsive components, enhancing the overall user experience.
React Redux: Redux was employed for state management, enabling the application to manage complex state transitions efficiently.
React Redux facilitated centralized state management and simplified data flow within the application.
Redux Thunk: Redux Thunk middleware was utilized to handle asynchronous actions in Redux. This allowed for the implementation of asynchronous data fetching from the CoinGecko API, ensuring smooth performance and responsiveness.
Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS was chosen for styling the user interface, offering a utility-first approach to CSS development. Tailwind CSS streamlined the styling process and facilitated the creation of visually appealing UI components.
Chart.js and React Chart.js: Chart.js and React Chart.js were used for data visualization, enabling the creation of interactive and customizable charts to display cryptocurrency price trends, market data, and historical performance.
CoinGecko API: The CoinGecko API served as the primary data source for fetching cryptocurrency-related information, including prices, market capitalization, trading volume, and more.
# Getting Started with Create React App.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
